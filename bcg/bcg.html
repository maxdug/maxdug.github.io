    <h1><b>LAB</b> | Learning at BCG</h1>

    <p>Boston Consulting Group is one of the "Big Three" consultancies and the second largest by revenue in the world. In 2019, I joined LAB, BCG’s internal learning team as they were transitioning from a in-house learning managment system to a third-party solution.</p>

    <p>My role was to lead UX design, engage stakeholders, and facilitate front-end development.</p>

    <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>My first year of the project was focused on launching the core functionality. After the initial launch, the challenge transitioned to testing and iterating on the experience.</p>

    <h2>Challenge of what we can and can’t customize</h2>
    <p>One of our biggest challenges was customizing the experience within a very rigid 3rd party platform. We were able to take control of the landing page and create small micro-site like pages to provide features that the base platform didn’t handle.</p>

    <h2>Navigating all the branches of global consulting</h2>
    <p>An early challenge was to improve learners' ability to browse an existing learning catalog that was organized in a manner that matched complex business structures, but was not intuitive to learners.</p>

    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>To solve the navigation problem, we took feedback from surveys, pulled analytics to find most used learning, ran card sorting to discover intuitive categories and structures, and built prototypes in Figma to run user driven testing.</p>
    <p>Within BCG, there are numerous types of employees and even companies across the world that we need to work with to discover ways to improve their learning experience and validate existing work. A major challenge was in choosing a language that would translate internationally. An example of this is killing very american sounding title for projects like “Development Playbook” to more common “Development Guide”</p>

    <h2>Bringin New Stakholders To The Platform</h2>
    <p>After launch of the platform, we were challenged to bring BCG subsidiary businesses on to the platform. So of these business used their own learning systems that ranged from external services to complex confluence implementations.</p>
    <p>The challenge was in quickly onboarding knowledge of an existing learning system and crossing features to the new platform.</p>
    <p>My sucsesses where in developing a module based system with a coresponding content matrix for assist communications when designing content for internal teams.</p>

    <h2>Guiding stakeholders through design process</h2>
    <p>For this project, I took ownership of the UI and UX of the platform - leading a team consisting of a BA, PM, and another designer. We worked on 20 individual projects from kickoff through go-live. For each project, I lead unique stakholders that represented a specific group of learners or curriculum at BCG.</p>

  <div class="new-text">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Because of resources available, I lead the stakeholders through translating their requirements into a cohesive learning journey within the platforms constraints, designing the UI, coding out the final solution and running testing at the various phases.</p>

    <h2>Designing a flexible system within constraints</h2>
    <p>This challenge of designing a UI system for BCGs learning platform was to keep inline with an established brand, and mix it with a UI of the Learning CMS that we couldn’t modify.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>The platform which we developed, provided a unique set of challenges with the chief among them being a restriction in the code we could use. When thinking about developing a UI pattern library to pull from, we only had HTML & CSS to work with. Through going back to basics, we were able to provide customized, interactive UI with clean CSS.</p>
  </div><!-- End New Text -->

**** Maybe I could actually include some of my CSS based UI Elements

  <div class="new-text">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>We also had a unique challenge where we couldn’t use media queries - the standard way to modify a website to be responsive. So this project became a masterclass in using flexbox to create modules that worked across all breakpoints.</p>
    <p>I was brought into BCG as a UX designer with the understanding that they needed some light development work as well.</p>
