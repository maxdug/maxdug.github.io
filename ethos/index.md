# My Ethos
Ethos / Religion / Philosophy / Maxims / Rules

This is how I try to live my life. My recipe for more happiness and less suffering. I organize this here to help me organize it in my mind.

## Ethics vs Ideals
The goal is to have etihical models by which I guide my actions and thoughts, but not ideals of the ways the word should be.

## Core Rules / Pillars
This is a priority list. Example: I need to protect my inner happiness before helping others - can't pour from an empty cup.
1. **Do no harm**
    * Don't impede the freedom of others
        * People, Enviroment, Animals
        * Don't make decisions for other people
        * Never share another's secret
            * Unless harm will be caused
    * Unless in defence of others or self
2. **Be happy**
    * Happiness is a state of knowing who you are and that you are living according to your ethos, it's not something obtained. With this belief, we can be happy in a chaotic world, even in negative situations.
        * Other terminology would be contintment or peace with life
        * The goal is to protect this state
        * Happiness from outcomes is like relying on medication to manage pain, while happiness from knowing you are acting within your beliefs is like feeling good because your treated the underlying issue causing pain. Achievements give you hits of happiness, but can also have withdrawal. This dependency limits your freedom.
        * Happiness can be grown, nourished and protected. 
        * This is not just self confidence, it's not a belief in your skills, it's a beliefe in your value.

3. **Help others**
    * Sometimes not doing this would interfer with our default happiness / self worth and therefore some level of sacrifice is required
    * Priority order in which I should provide any support I can. Emotional and Material
        1. Partner
        2. Friends & Family
            * Make an effort to go and see friends in person
            * Gifts should be consumable
                * Experiences
                * Food
                * Books
                * Stories/ photos
        3. Society
            * Have faith in humanity
            * Factors that affect ability to change someone's mind
                * Thier original belief
                * What they value
                * What/ Who they trust
        4. Environment
            * Promote Leave no trace
            * Use as little as possible to accomplish my goals

## Practical Rules
* Make tomorrow simpler
    * Live in the physical world following leave no trace, everything in it's place 
    * Identify what matters, elimnate the rest
    * Part of living in the moment and not getting help back by the past and the future is trusting your mind to remember what's important and not documenting and holding on the everthing
    * Optimize (not minimize) Personal to allow for Friends, Family, and Work
    * Constantly distill and summarize clutter, both physical and mental
    * Planning reduces cognative load
    * Inteligence is creating future opportunity
        * Organization helps
* Shit happens - Deal with it or move on
* Don't Engage Stupid
    * People are neither good nor bad, there is ignorance who talk about others being good or bad ar typically bad.
    * Have a backbone, don't stand down if you are not going to be hurt or in the defense of another
    exception?
        * I need to have a plan in place for the problem of encountering a cheater or lier. My philosophy of "Don't Engage Stupid", conflicts with the need for having a backbone and defending truth. This has been on my mind with the recent election, where I wish I would have posted on social media and talked more openly about the reasons for my views. I think my decisions on whether to disengage or not should be based on my analysis of my chances of effecting change. How do I make this analysis quicker? Could I group types of behavior that I should overlook and types that I should call out or provide an alternative argument. I'm thinking that most 1 on 1 stanger interactions are near impossible to affect change. I think of the Chris Deloux song cowboy hat. Introductions are key to affecting strangers - not letting them loop me into a group they hate, but keeping myself viewed as an individual. after introductions, even with friends and family. Are there charactaristics that make it not worth the effort of explaining - "Stupid"? How do I deal with groups. 
        * Don't engage stranger individualy
        * Let your opinion be known to groups



## Purpose
I believe the purpose of life is to live - interacting with the world, eating, sleeping, having fun.

## Applications
### Traditional Examples
* The Trolley Problem: A runaway trolley is heading towards five people tied to a track. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto another track, where it will kill one person instead. The dilemma is whether to take action that results in one death to save five.
    * I would pull the lever. I see this as aligning best with my rule #1 and doing **less** harm.
* The Lifeboat Dilemma: A lifeboat is overcrowded and at risk of sinking. If one person is thrown overboard, the others will survive. The dilemma involves deciding whether to sacrifice one person for the greater good.
    * I would jump overboard following rule #1
* The Doctor's Dilemma: A doctor has five patients who need organ transplants to survive. A healthy patient comes in for a check-up. The dilemma is whether to sacrifice the healthy patient to save the five.
    * I would not sacrifice the health patient. They are not breaking the exception to rule #1 - I am not defending the others from that person, I would be harming that person. Helping others comes after doing no harm.
