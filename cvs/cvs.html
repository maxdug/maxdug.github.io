        <h4><b>Agency</b> | Razorfish within Publicis Groupe</h4>
        <h4><b>Role</b> | Asscosiate Design Director</h4>
        <p>I joined Razorfish for the redesign of CVS's e-commerce platform. I went on to lead CVS projects across the B2B and B2C spectrum. Our creative teams consisted of myself working as UX / Visual lead. with additional UX, visual, and copy support.</p>

    <h3>Establishing Collaboration From the Beginning</h3>
    <p>I started each project by aligning on a design process and a "strategic" persona with everyone involved. My design process is a modified double diamond model with regular checkpoints. We used a strategic persona called the "informed household manager" as a litmus test for our work.</p>

    <h3>Customizing Deliverables for Client Need</h3>
    <p>Every project requires unique solutions vs going through the motions of standard UX tasks. For the CVS Drug Information Center, we combined content analysis into our user flow. This allowed us to workshop with the client on what was possible and got us into design quicker.</p>

    <h3>Elevated Look &amp; Feel</h3>
    <p>Our target was to take their current design from saying clinical to health and wellness. We created a system that utilized unique shapes, iconography, and line work. We designed modules to showcase lifestyle photography. The restrained yet playful design elevates the experience and injects character and personality.</p>

  <h3>Design System</h3>
  <p>We started building the design system from the discovery phase of the process. Focusing on the long term modularity over the look of individual compositions. This increased prototyping speed and overall robustness. A big benefit was the ability to do accessibility reviews at the design system level.</p>

  <h3>CVS Shop Redesign</h3>
  <p>CVS challenged Razorfish to rethink their e-commerce experience. They wanted the online experience to match their health and wellness mission in-store. By assigning categories to their new secondary colors, we improved the visual and functional experience. We gave customers have full control over their fulfillment method. Giving the ability to set a preference at any point in the experience, much like food delivery apps.</p>

  <h3>CVS Media Exchange® (CMX)</h3>
  <p>CMX leverages unique CVS data and customer base for personalized brand marketing. They came to us to relaunch CMX from an outdated single information page to a microsite. The unique challenge with this project was to create a B2B site. It had to share CVS's unique data and health-focused value propositions.</p>
