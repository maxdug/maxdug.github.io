  <h1>Astoria Runners</h1>
  <p>A few years ago, I joined a local running group as I was training for a half marathon. The group is an integral part of my community and a  fulfilling part of living in this neighborhood. Over the years, the group has seen changes as it welcomed many more newcomers and introduced new events to the calendar. We were ready for a refreshed visual identity and digital presence that reflected that growth. I volunteered some ideas to help tell our story visually.</p>

<div class="tentwentyfour">
  <h2>Logo exploration</h2>
  <p>There were two existing logos in use. I wanted the new mark to feel current, while still paying homage to the original designs.</p>

    <h3>Existing Version</h3>
    <p>The thin lines didn’t scale well across applications</p>

    <h3>Existing Version</h3>
    <p>The dramatic angles were tricky to fit across applications</p>

    <h3>Ideation One</h3>
    <p>Simplified shapes based on a classic runners sash</p>
  </div>

    <img src="logo-4.jpg" alt=" ">
    <h3>Ideation Two</h3>
    <p>Inspired by the bridge underpasses seen on many streets in Astoria</p>

    <h2>Chosen direction</h2>
    <p>The new logo keeps the familiar A shape, but looks more like a playful twist on a classic runners sash. The new identity is to be used on our social media pages, calendar, and even ‘fits for in person events!</p>

    <h2>Shirts</h2>
    <p>While there is the need for the group to have a recognizable shirt for races and events, the visual identity is versatile enough to allow for flexibility and show our core principle of having fun.</p>
