  <h1><b>LAB</b> | Learning at BCG</h1>

  <p>Boston Consulting Group is one of the "Big Three" consultancies and the second largest by revenue in the world. In 2019, I joined LAB, BCG’s internal learning team as they were transitioning from a in-house learning managment system to a third-party solution.</p>

  <p>My role was to lead UX design, engage stakeholders, and facilitate front-end development.</p>

  <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
  <p>My first year of the project was focused on launching the core functionality. After the initial launch, the challenge transitioned to testing and iterating on the experience.</p>

  <h2>Personalization without Sacrificing Functionality</h2>
  <p>Our biggest challenge was to provide a streamlined, personalized experience for learners, despite some confusing, fixed UI in the learning management system (LMS). Our solution was to focus on entry points and side-steped the LMS, instead of competing. We created a new landing and micro-site pages that guide learners through personalized learning journeys.</p>

    <h2>Bringin New Stakholders To The Platform</h2>
    <p>After launch of the platform, we were challenged to bring BCG subsidiary businesses on to the platform. So of these business used their own learning systems that ranged from external services to complex confluence implementations.</p>
    <p>The challenge was in quickly onboarding knowledge of an existing learning system and crossing features to the new platform.</p>
    <p>My sucsesses where in developing a module based system with a coresponding content matrix for assist communications when designing content for internal teams.</p>

    <h2>Guiding stakeholders through design process</h2>
    <p>For this project, I took ownership of the UI and UX of the platform - leading a team consisting of a BA, PM, and another designer. We worked on 20 individual projects from kickoff through go-live. For each project, I lead unique stakholders that represented a specific group of learners or curriculum at BCG.</p>
    <p>Because of resources available, I lead the stakeholders through translating their requirements into a cohesive learning journey within the platforms constraints, designing the UI, coding out the final solution and running testing at the various phases.</p>

  <h2>Navigation based on research, not business structure</h2>
  <p>Reviewing our analytics exposed that learners struggled to navigate our complex learning catalog. The catalog matched the business structure, but this was not intuitive to learners. We started the discovery process, with the goal to redesign without business bias. </p>
  <p>During the 2020 pandemic, we got creative and used note taking software run card sorting.</p>

    An interesting discovery from navigation testing was international wording preferences. One example was the preference for “Guide”, vs the American preference for “Playbook”.

    <h2>Getting my hands dirty with development</h2>
    <p>The platform which we developed, provided a unique set of challenges with the chief among them being a restriction in the code we could use. When thinking about developing a UI pattern library to pull from, we only had HTML & CSS to work with. Through going back to basics, we were able to provide customized, interactive UI with clean CSS.</p>
    <p>We also had a unique challenge where we couldn’t use media queries - the standard way to modify a website to be responsive. So this project became a masterclass in using flexbox to create modules that worked across all breakpoints.</p>
    <p>I was brought into BCG as a UX designer with the understanding that they needed some light development work as well.</p>
