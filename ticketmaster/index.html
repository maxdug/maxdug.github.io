        <p>Ticketmaster needed help defining and launching a campaign to engage music managers. We designed a microsite promoting a new platform that would give artists and artist managers support from Ticketmaster and insider access to powerful insights about the industry.</p>

        <h3>Visual Identity</h3>
        <p>We created a bold design for a space where the clients are rock stars. We drew on a spotlight metaphor to represent live events. This metaphor influenced the shapes, colors, and photography used in the design. We used a dark background to create a foundation for bold color contrast, adding excitement, warmth, and energy.</p>

    <h3>Homepage</h3>
    <p>We employed our spotlight motif for a simple hero image that highlights the headline. The metaphor is carried through into the design system with a card style reminiscent of a record sleeve.. We iterated with both horizontal and vertical carousels and cards that can handle various lengths of metadata. In situations where the imagery needs to relay detail to the user, we pulled the image out of the circle and provided more real-estate.</p>

    <h3>Live Music Data</h3>
    <p>This new platform harnessed the power of Ticketmaster’s unparalleled data. It provided powerful insights, making it easy for managers to make smarter decisions. We designed the microsite to be responsive to ensure important information isn’t overlooked no matter the device. Data and imagery are overlapped to balance the information density with striking visuals.</p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>On the resources page we crafted a case study piece that focused on featured artists, using their logos as key identifiers. We followed complex components like this with simple iconography based cards to balance the page flow.</p>

    <h3>Chart Details</h3>
    <p>We used Ticketmaster charts to tease the power of the app platform and push users towards conversion. For these pages, we didn’t use a spotlight hero, opting to not break the flow of the horizontal lines. We made the complex table mobile-friendly by focusing on data and removing descriptive text.</p>

    <h3>Case Study</h3>
    <p>We made the desktop version of Case Study Details easier to read by using a narrow column width. When there is enough space horizontally, we added a sticky component with related case studies for further discovery. We created an image collage component where data points are seamlessly integrated by sharing an edge within an image frame.</p>
