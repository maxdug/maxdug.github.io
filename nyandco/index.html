    <h4><b>Role</b> | Senior Visual Design</h4>

    <h4><b>Team</b> | Tember Hopkins • Pamela Tamayo</h4>

    <p>New York & Company is a retailer for women's accessories and apparel. I worked on the design of a kiosk that allowed in-store customers and employees to access the larger online inventory. This lead to an increased adoption rate of their website by in-store customers.</p>

    <h3><b>Unique</b> Viewport</h3>

    <p>We took advantage of the format with large imagery to grab the user when browsing, and designed modals to make sensitive checkout information more inconspicuous.</p>

    <h3><b>Prototyping</b> Interaction</h3>

    <p>To understand the quirks of working with an extra large touch screen we used Invision prototypes on a test kiosk throughout the process.</p>
