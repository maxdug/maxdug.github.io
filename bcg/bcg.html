  <p>Utilizing BCG's internal employee input panel and analytics team, we were able to continually test ideas with real users for a data-driven design approach. To facilitate research, I created a discussion guides and conducted 4 major user interview projects with 50+ participants.</p>

  <h3>Overlaying Data</h3>
  <p>The first step in analysis of the new learning platform was to map the experience end-to-end. This allowed the team to identify easy wins and envision the happy path. From this master user flow, my team and I broke out discrete flows and layered qualitative data to show context and help stakeholders prioritize improvements.</p>

  <h3>Card Sorting During the Pandemic</h3>
  <p>Analytics identified that learners struggled navigating our catalog.   In the midst of the pandemic, we used a note app (Workflowy) to run virtual card sorting.  This allowed a streamlined interface, where we could duplicate and save each configuration. We discovered that our catalog  was based on an non-intuative business structure.</p>

  <h3>User Interviews</h3>
  <p>We followed card sorting by building a prototype and running moderated user interviews. For the virtual interviews, I developed a discussion guide that ran on a seperate laptop to keep my conversation with the participants seamless. Participants responded to titles that matched areas for improvement in their quarterly reviews.</p>

  <h3>Visual Design That’s Not From Scratch</h3>
  <p>To keep our work across stakeholders and platforms consistent, we utilized a pattern library based on Atomic Design principles. A huge plus with utilizing modular design components is that nailing down their logic saves valuable time in development since all the teams are using the same vernacular.</p>

  <h2>Digging Into Development</h2>
  <p>In addition to my product design work, I took over some light development work. The LMS platform had unique restrictions, limiting us to pure HTML & CSS and not allowing media queries to target specific breakpoints. With these limitations, this project became a masterclass in using Flexbox to create modules that worked across all breakpoints.
