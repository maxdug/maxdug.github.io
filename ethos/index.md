# My Ethos
I believe the purpose of life is to live - interacting with the world, eating, sleeping, having fun. This page is a collection of the principles that help me as I try to live my life. I organize it here to help me organize it in my mind. A freshmen philosophy major might destroy it, but it works for me! :)

## Guiding Principles
I aim to have ethical guidelines for my actions and thoughts, not ideals of how the world should be.

### Core Principles
This is a priority list - I value not harming others above my own happiness, and securing my inner peace before acting to help others — I can't pour from an empty cup!
1. #### Do no harm
    * Don't impede the freedom of others
        * People, Enviroment, Animals
        * Don't make decisions for other people
        * Never share another's secret unless it causes harm
    * Unless in defence of others or self
    * Always pay my debts
2. #### Be happy
    * Happiness is a state of knowing who you are and that you are living according to your ethos, it's not something obtained. With this belief, we can be happy in a chaotic world, even in negative situations.
        * Other terminology would be contintment or peace with life
        * The goal is to protect this state
        * Happiness from outcomes is like using medication for pain relief, while happiness from living your values is like addressing the root cause of the pain. Achievements can give you quick bursts of happiness, but they can also lead to dependency that can limit your freedom.
        * Happiness can be grown, nourished and protected. 
        * This is not just self confidence, it's not a belief in your skills, it's a beliefe in your value.
        * Core skill is abililitiy to reframe life in a positive light
3. #### Help others
    * Do the **most** good
    * Sometimes not doing this would interfer with our default happiness / self worth and therefore some level of sacrifice is required
    * Priority order in which I should provide any support I can. Emotional and Material
        1. Partner
        2. Friends & Family
        3. Society
        4. Environment
4. #### People are inherently good / Banality of evil
    * I choose to believe in humanity. I believe there is no "evil", just extreme cases of people acting in extreme ways because of their enviroment and basic human desires that become warped or accelerated.
5. #### Sometimes I'm wrong / Don't lie to myself

### Practical Principles
* #### Make tomorrow simpler
    * Live in the physical world following leave no trace, everything in it's place 
    * Identify what matters, elimnate the rest
    * Trust that my mind is a powerful filter and let's go of memories I don't need
    * Don't live based on an assumed future or past
        * Ability to let go previous visions or expectations
        * Example: Don't wait around on inheritences or "when we have more money" or "when things normalize"

    * Optimize (not minimize) Personal to allow for Friends, Family, and Work
    * Constantly distill and summarize clutter, both physical and mental
    * Planning reduces cognative load
    * Inteligence is creating future opportunity
        * Organization helps
* #### Shit happens - Deal with it or move on
* #### Don't Engage Stupid
    * People are neither good nor bad, there is ignorance who talk about others being good or bad ar typically bad.
    * If safe, don't agree with something you don't agree with.
        * It is ok to lie if it will difuse a dangerous situation and not cause additional harm.
    * How to manage when you can’t disengage?
    * This doesn’t mean that I won’t share knowledge when I believe it can make a difference. 
    * I want to avoid triggering defensive reactions in others.
	    * It’s important to engage with others with proper introductions that relay that I am an individual with an open mind and good intentions, not a representative of any group, like liberal or conservative.
        * Don't engage stranger individualy
        * Let your opinion be known to groups
        * Factors that affect ability to change someone's mind
            * Thier original belief
            * What they value
            * What/ Who they trust
* #### Don't Complain if you are going to do it anyway
* #### Deal with what is weighing most on your mind
* #### Keep to the Plan, One task at a time
* #### Don't rush anything you don't have to
* #### Prioritize Sleep
    * no phone, tv, or anything in the bedroom.
    * The bedroom is only for sleep, sex, and clothes
* #### Prioritize Exersise
    * every day eliptical and stretching routine or running
* #### Eat real Food
    * Eat real food, not to much, mostly plants
* #### Entertainment is not a hobby
* #### Don't be an asshole, defer to others whenever possible
* #### Generally I don't drink
    * I don't wish to be drunk ever again, I believe I can have more fun this way
    * My evolving list of exceptions include wedding toasts, trying someones drink for taste, and when I know it will be only one drink
* #### Cut out people that hold you back
* #### Change environment to accomplish goals

### Goals
What is my ideal perfect year, month, decade. Not specific goals, but things that I want to reocurr 
* visiting old friends
* big hiking trips
* longer time with family
* regular medical and dental checkins
* beach trips
* car camping trips
* weekly friend hangouts
* cultural events like plays and concerts

## Applications
### Traditional Examples
* **The Trolley Problem:** A runaway trolley is heading towards five people tied to a track. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto another track, where it will kill one person instead. The dilemma is whether to take action that results in one death to save five.
    * I would pull the lever. I see this as aligning best with my rule #1 and doing **less** harm.
* **The Lifeboat Dilemma:** A lifeboat is overcrowded and at risk of sinking. If one person is thrown overboard, the others will survive. The dilemma involves deciding whether to sacrifice one person for the greater good.
    * I would jump overboard following rule #1
* **The Doctor's Dilemma:** A doctor has five patients who need organ transplants to survive. A healthy patient comes in for a check-up. The dilemma is whether to sacrifice the healthy patient to save the five.
    * I would not sacrifice the health patient. They are not breaking the exception to rule #1 - I am not defending the others from that person, I would be harming that person. Helping others comes after doing no harm.
