    <h1><b>UWM</b><br>Adaptive Dashboard</h1>
    <h4><b>Agency</b> | Fluid</h4>
    <h4><b>Role</b> | Project Lead - Senior UX Designer</h4>
    <p>United Wholesale Mortgage is the largest wholesale mortgage lender. They focus on loan officers vs selling directly to the end borrowers. We engaged the loan officers with a one-stop-shop dashboard of tools and information. We worked with both their marketing and development teams in an agile process. Our concept was to take tools that lived behind a login wall and place that power and usefulness on the homepage.</p>

<h3>Discovering a Content Divide</h3>
<p>During discovery, content analysis revealed a divide between UWM's marketing and tools. By combining the two, we could make a more intuitive platform for users upon site entry.</p>

<div class="content half"><a class="max" rel="group" href="uwm-analysis.jpg" title="• I distilled the content model into sections and graphed where they lived. • Users were blocked from content because it was bifurcated between the public facing and logged-in sides of the site."><img src="uwm-analysis.jpg" alt=" "/></a></div>

<h3>Sorting Content by Type and Zone</h3>
<p>We developed an overarching content model. I identified primary content types and sorted content in zones.</p>
</div>
<div class="content half"><a class="max" rel="group" href="uwm-content-model.jpg" title="I also took the content and broke it up by purpose. This modeling allowed us to zone our design by the various content uses."><img src="uwm-content-model.jpg" alt=" "/></a></div>

<h3>Understanding The Target Audience</h3>
<p>As a part of discovery, I ran ethnographic studies with loan officers. This provided us the insight about which tools and information really provided value to their day-to-day business. We discovered the loyalty a good user experience could bring to their B2B relationships.</p>

<h3>User Journey</h3>
<p>A big part of the challenge was dealing with users at various states, for this, we made user journeys in addition to breaking the site architecture up by logged in, logged out, and cookied users.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>Instead of using analytics strictly to develop our navigation modal, we humanized it by making our navigation match the day of a loan officer. Following up on major categories, we created a module system for the mega menus, so that the site could grow over time.</p>

<div class="content third"><a class="max" rel="group" href="uwm-proposed-architecture.jpg" title="By modifying our content model, I developed a site model to show the general navigation structure."><img src="uwm-proposed-architecture.jpg" alt=" "/></a></div>

<h3>From the whiteboard to Final Designs</h3>
<p>Because of the speed of this project and my history in visual design, we went in with a goal of high fidelity wireframes. We utilized sketches features, and from the smallest elements, I built the sketch file so that visual design could come in and replace generic styles, rather than building from scratch. I involved visual design as early in the process as possible, so that they could be in on the very first UI decisions.</p>

<h3>Keeping it all together</h3>
<p>We managed a high level of complexity by utilizing a single source of reference for the entire team.  Confluence was used as an ever-changing wiki for requirements gathering, functional specs, design, and assets. The documentation structure was based on the site architecture and secondary structure on the atomic design model for the UI. The payoff came during transfer from design to engineering. Engineers could quickly move between tickets in Jira back through epics and stories to Confluence, and find all the information they needed from design.</p>
