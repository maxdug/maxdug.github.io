New York & Company is a retailer for women's accessories and apparel. I worked on the design of a kiosk that allowed in-store customers and employees to access the larger online inventory. This lead to an increased adoption rate of their website by in-store customers.

We took advantage of the format with large imagery to grab the user when browsing, and designed modals to make sensitive checkout information more inconspicuous.
### **Prototyping** Interaction
To understand the quirks of working with an extra large touch screen we used Invision prototypes on a test kiosk throughout the process.
