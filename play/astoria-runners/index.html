  <h4><b>Identity and digital assets</b></h4>

  <p>A few years ago I was traingin for a half marathon and came across a local running group. They've since become an integral part of my life. Not being able to help myself, I started to play around with some possible logo treatments and have since proposed it to the group and we've started to utilize it to tell our story visually.</p>

    <p>To take on the challenge of how to present complex ideas to the client and how to fledge out ideas, our team would often have me take our sketches into animation to fledge out the interactions.</p>
