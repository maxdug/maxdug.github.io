# Personal Website
At it's core, this site is a portfolio because I need one for my career. (Boo capitalism) But... I it's also my hobby. I’m not the best developer—I’m really a designer at heart. But I love experimenting, and I’m lucky to have some amazing developer friends just a chat away. 

# Goal
I want to document life, book reviews, recipes, art, etc... But I want to keep some minimalism. I also want to fight bit rot and keep the sites tech stack super simple, keeping as much of the content in simple markdown as possible and just using fully supported html, css and a pinch of javascript. For editing, I really do like using github.dev and being able to edit this site from anywhere. 

## Inspirations
I'm inspired by some fantastic everything sites that are mind gardens like:
* sheldonbrown.com (a treasure trove for bike info)
* gwern.net (An experiment in a massive amount of writing)

* [Portfolio](https://maxduggan.com/)
* [Side Projects](https://maxduggan.com/play)
* [Recipes](https://maxduggan.com/recipes)
* [My Life Philosophy](https://maxduggan.com/ethos)

### Future
* Pondering moving to elevently with theme eleventy-garden over jekyll
