# Chick'n & Rice Soup
![Enchiladas Verde](https://maxduggan.com/cvs/cvs-hero.jpg "Enchiladas Verde")

## Make the Chick'n
* In large glass bowl, mix together
    * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
    * 2 teaspoons onion powder
    * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
    * Generous grinds of pepper
    * 1/8 teaspoon turmeric
    * 1/4 cup (30g) nutritional yeast flakes
    * 1/2 cup (60g) bread flour
    * 1 1/2 cups (180g) vital wheat gluten
* Add 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar and 2 cups(472g) water and mix well
* Divide the dough into nuggest size pieces
* From this point, be careful not to overhandle the seitan because you want it to retain it’s texture, which will allow it to separate nicely once cooked. 
* In a large pot bring 10 cups of water / seasoned broth to a boil. Lower heat. 
* Add the seitan pieces. Let stew very gently without boiling for about 15 minutes.
* When skin is set, place the lid ajar for steam to escape and low boil for about 45 more minutes.
* Cool completely in broth. Pull apart and use how ever you want* It tastes best if browned in some olive oil first.
## Make the Soup
* Preheat a 4 quart pot over medium heat. Saute chick’n in olive oil with a pinch of salt until nicely browned. Remove from pot and set aside.
* Saute onion in butter with a pinch of salt for about 5 minutes, until translucent. Add carrots and celery and cook for about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about a minute, using a little extra butter if you like. Add poultry seasoning, salt and pepper and saute a minute more.
* Add rice and broth. Cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, bring down to a simmer, and let cook for about 15 more minutes, until rice is cooked and carrot is tender.
* Stir in the chick’n and dill and taste for salt and pepper. This definitely tastes better the longer you let it sit, but it can be enjoyed right away, too. Garnish with extra dill and serve!
     
* 1 teaspoon of fine dill weed
* Make Carrots optional
* Cut chickn pieces into smaller pieces (Sugar cube size)
