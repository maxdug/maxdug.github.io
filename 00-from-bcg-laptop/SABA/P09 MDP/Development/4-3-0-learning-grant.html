  <b>Q: Where can I apply for the Learning Immersion Grant Program?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Please reach out to <a style="color: #0a8; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:whipkey.melissa@bcg.com">Melissa Whipkey</a> or <a style="color: #0a8; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:gockel.jutta@bcg.com">Jutta Gockel</a>. They will send you the link to the application survey. As soon as we have reviewed your application, we will get back to you to inform if your learning grant has been approved.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <b>Q: What kind of learning programs are covered by the Learning Immersion Grant Program?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> The learning grant program aims to support Managing Director and Senior Partners' personal and professional development beyond what is internally offered by BCG. We take into consideration that with increasing seniority the need for more individualized and customized learning increases as well and therefore want to expand training opportunities to external offerings. Training subjects can include:<br><br>
        <span style="flex:1 0 100%; list-style-type: disc;">
          <span style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Specific expertise relevant to your role and/or topic area</span>
          <span style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Strategic Leadership</span>
          <span style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Commercial Expertise to increase your commercial impact</span>
          <span style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Personal and Team Sustainability</span>
        </span><br>
        If your training does not fall into one of these categories, please let us know why it is still relevant for you and beneficial for your career at BCG. External trainings that have the same objectives to what is offered internally are excluded from the grant program.<br><br><br>

  <b>Q: How much of the costs of my external training can be covered by the Learning Grant Program?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Global MDP L&D has reserved a limited grant amount for this year's pilot program and grants will be approved on a first come first served basis. Depending on the training costs, full or partial costs will be reimbursed.<br><br><br>

  <b>Q: When and how do I receive the grant?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> As this is a reimbursement program, you will need to cover the costs first. After having successfully completed the training, send us a short message including a prove for successful completion and we will provide you with the case code you can use to expense the amount granted. <br><br><br>

  <b>Q: What happens if I cannot complete the training?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> We only reimburse trainings that have been successfully completed. If you cannot complete the training, you will be responsible to cover the training costs yourself.<br><br><br>

  <b>Q: Where can I receive additional information on the Learning Grant Program?</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> If you have any other questions, please contact <a style="color: #0a8; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:whipkey.melissa@bcg.com">Melissa Whipkey</a> or <a style="color: #0a8; text-decoration: none;" href="mailto:gockel.jutta@bcg.com">Jutta Gockel</a> from the Global MDP L&D team.<br><br><br>
