  <h1>Astoria Runners</h1>
  <p>A few years ago I joined the local running group for the best neighborhood in NYC. They've since become an integral part of my life, and not being able to help myself, I created an updated identity that we've started to utilize. This page is in progress and will be updated soon.</p>

  <h2>Logo exploration</h2>
  <p>There was a mix of two existing logos used across the groups digital presence. I wanted to make a new mark while still paying homage to the original designs. The overarching theme was the runners a red sash.</p>

    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <p>For the t-shirts I utilized the idea of the sash for something that would stand out in a race. I wanted something that would go across the chest and use the primary logo on the bottom.</p>
