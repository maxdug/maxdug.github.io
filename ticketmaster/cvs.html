        <h1><b>CVS</b><br>Reimagining Health &amp; Wellness Online</h1>
        <h4><b>Agency</b> | Razorfish within Publicis Groupe</h4>
        <h4><b>Role</b> | Asscosiate Design Director</h4>
        <p>I joined Razorfish for the redesign of CVS's e-commerce platform and went on to lead CVS projects across the B2B and B2C spectrum. Our creative teams typically consisted of myself working as UX / Visual lead with additional UX, visual, and copy support, reporting to group directors.</p>

    <h3>Establishing Collaboration From the Begining</h3>
    <p>At the start of each project, I prioritized sharing the design process and a "stategic" persona - creating alignment with stakeholders. My design process is a modified double diamond model with regular checkpoints. To keep everyone aligned, we also created a strategic persona: the "informed household manager" to use as the litumus test for our work.</p>

    <h3>Customizing Deliverables for Client Need</h3>
    <p>For the development of CVS's Drug Information Center, we needed to do more than go through the motions of standard UX deliverables. We realized that combining content analysis into our user flow created a tool that allowed us to align quickly with CVS on what was possible and got us into design quicker.</p>

    <h3>Elevated Look &amp; Feel</h3>
    <p>Our target was to take their current design from saying clinical to health and wellness. We created a system that utilized unique shapes and line work iconography with modules built show off quality life photography. The restrained yet playful design elevates the online experience by injecting moments of character and personality.</p>

  <h3>Design System</h3>
  <p>Every step of the design process involved the design system - Increasing prototyping speed and robustness. Our end goal was to create versatility where any mix of modules worked, vs static template designs. We were also able to do accesability reviews at the design system level and have it underpin the product's user experience.</p>

  <h3>CVS Shop Redesign</h3>
  <p>CVS came to Razorfish with the desire to rethink their online experience, with special attention focused on how that experience tied in with their current missions in-store. We crafted an elevated e-commerce experience that provided a unique focus on giving the user full power over their fulfillment of purchases. The navigation utilized their new secondary colors and pushed them further by assigning purpose and categories.</p>

  <h3>CVS Drug Information Center</h3>
  <p>CVS provides drug information as part of their mission is to provide resources that establish them as a go-to resource in the health and wellness space. Our unique challenge was designing a Drug Info Center that supported pharmacy customers and drove search engine traffic through to the rest of the CVS ecosystem, whether that’s the shop or clinical side of the business.</p>

  <h3>CVS Media Exchange® (CMX)</h3>
  <p>CMX leverages CVS’s unique data to enable brands to market in a personalized and meaningful with their customer base. They came to us to relaunch this side of their business. The unique challenge with this project was to create a B2B site that shared data and results as the primary value proposition, while still showing that CVS’s health focus was their primary differentiation in the market.</p>
