# Recipes
My wife and I are pescitarian, but all of the recipes below are vegitarian or vegan. I like to translate all of the recipes to have ingredient amount inline in the directions. Groccery checklists are at the bottom of each recipe.

## Mains
* [Chick'n & Rice Soup](./chickn-and-rice-soup)
* [Enchiladas Verde](./enchiladas-verde)

## Ingredients
## Bread
## Desserts
