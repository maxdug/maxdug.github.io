## Directions
### Recent Notes

* Nooch with breadcrumbs 
* Smaller fish stick size pieces 
* Little bit of flour in mustard oil mixture for stickiness 

### Marinate Tofu ahead of time

* Drain and press the tofu
* Slice the tofu into four 
* Then slice each half to make thin
* To make the flaky texture, take one of the tofu pieces and slice the tofu part way through repeatedly about ¼" apart. It's helpful to use chopsticks on either side of the tofu to stop from cutting all the way through the tofu so the slices remain intact. See the photos in the post for a visual guide.
* Mix the marinade: mix together the in gallo ziplock or container
* ½ cup vegetable broth
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp white miso paste
* ½ tsp onion powder
* ¼ tsp salt
* being careful to handle them gently so they don't fall apart
* Let marinate for a minimum of 1 hour or as long as a few days covered in the fridge
* I usually marinate it overnight in the fridge.
