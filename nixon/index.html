    <h1><b>Nixon</b><br>Personalization</h1>
    <h4><b>Agency</b> | Fluid</h4>
    <h4><b>Role</b> | Lead Designer</h4>
    <p>After a successful site redesign, Nixon wanted to use Fluid's Configure customization platform for the release of their first Androidwear smartwatch - The Mission. I was brought in to lead Nixon through the process of selecting which base features were needed and how to structure them to create the most intuitive experience.</p>

  <h3>Complex Challenges</h3>
  <p>There are lots of customization tools popping up, but I found that they take the user on complex journeys that require prior knowledge of that specific tool. I strove to make our system as uncomplicated as possible, within the technical framework of the Configure system and keeping the overall look and structure feeling like a part of the Nixon product page family.</p>

  <h3>Unique Solutions</h3>
  <p>In the end, I believe we achieved a huge success in Nixon not just launching a smart watch, but a custom PDP that was simple and intuitive for the user. For the main menu of the interface, we went with a standard accordion design. In order to increase options, we had to add scrolling on desktop and extend options on mobile.</p>
