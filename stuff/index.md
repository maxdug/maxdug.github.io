# My Philosophy on Money and Stuff

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the items I want to acquire, helping me be intentional and avoid wastefulness.

This could also be an area for people to see what I would want as a gift or if they have the thing, maybe trade for it. I am very very particular and don't like gifts that aren't the thing I imagine having for life - that is just wasteful.

spend a dollar to save a penny

### When to Upgrade
Even if an item is not completely broken, is there a point where there are enough other factors to justify an upgrade?
- Will the upgrade use less resouces (upgrading from an old truck to a Prius)
- Is the original item in a shape that it can't be donated (It's going live in a landfill eventualy, so why not have it start degrading sooner)
- Will the upgrade improve quality of life in ways that save resources (Buying a less finicky rice cooker get's you to eat at home moer)
- Is the new item of a quality that you believe it will last you the rest of your life?
- When it comes to recycling, or disposing of stuff, I value my life sometimes over being perfect. Big companies have made us feel like the waste problem is soley on the consumers shoulders. I will continue to get rid of things that don't add value to my life so that I can maintain a simple space, but start to buy from companies that support repair.


## Key benefits:
1. Alow me to think about it more - having to open a editor and type something into a priority list allows you to think if it's really going to improve your quality of life over something else or just saving to be more financially secure. 
2. Allows me to prioritize stuff, give me a space to compare wx to yz.
