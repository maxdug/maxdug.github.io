  <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
  <p>Our goal was to streamline the transfer of money for the customers, while keeping within the boundaries of banking laws and the existing Citi look and feel. We innovated with new interactions like “slide-to-pay” that gave customers increased validation when completing a transaction.</p>
