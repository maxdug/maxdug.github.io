        <h4><b>Agency</b> | Razorfish within Publicis Groupe</h4>
        <h4><b>Role</b> | Asscosiate Design Director</h4>
        <p>I joined Razorfish for the redesign of CVS's eccomerce platform and went on to lead CVS projects across the B2B and B2C spectrum. Our creative teams typically consisted of myself working as UX / Visual lead with additional UX, visual, and copy support, reporting to group directors.</p>

    <h3>Establishing Collaboration From the Begining</h3>
    <p>Across all my CVS projects, I prioritized sharing a visual design process and a "stategic" persona - creating alignment with stakeholders from the onset. My design process is a modified double diamond model with a regular checkpoints. To keep everyone aligned on the visual, we also created CVS was a a strategic persona of an "informed household manager" to use as the litumus test for our designs.</p>

    <h3>Customizing Deliverables for Client Need</h3>
    <p>For the development of CVS's Drug Information Center, we needed to do more than go through the motions of standard UX deliverables. We realized that combining content analysis into our user flow created a tool that allowed us to align quickly with CVS on what was possible and got us into design quicker.</p>

    <h3>Elevated Look &amp; Feel</h3>
    <p>Our target was to take their current design from saying clinical to health and wellness. We created a system that utilized unique shapes and line work iconography with modules built show off quality life photography. The restrained yet playful design elevates the online experience by injecting moments of character and personality.</p>

  <h3>Design System</h3>
  <p>Every step of the design process involved the design system - Increasing prototyping speed and robustness. Our end goal was to create versatility where any mix of modules worked, vs static template designs. We were also able to do accesability reviews at the design system level and have it underpin the product's user experience.</p>
