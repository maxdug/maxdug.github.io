# **New York & Company** In-store Kiosk
### **Role** | Senior Visual Design
### **Team** | Tember Hopkins â€¢ Pamela Tamayo
New York & Company asked Fluid to develop an in-store kiosk that allows customers to browse and purchase from a larger online inventory while in store act as an employee tool to help customers. The kiosk integrated barcode scanner and credit card terminal and aimed to drive more in-store customers to the website.

## **Unique** Viewport
We took advantage of the format with large imagery to grab the user when browsing, and designed modals to make sensitive checkout information more inconspicuous.
## **Prototyping** Interaction
To understand the quirks of working with an extra large touch screen we used Invision prototypes on a test kiosk throughout the process.
