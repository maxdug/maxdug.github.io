  <h1><b>LAB</b> | Learning at BCG</h1>

  <p>Boston Consulting Group is one of the "Big Three" consultancies and the second largest by revenue in the world. In 2019, I joined LAB, BCG’s internal learning team as they transitioned from an in-house learning managment system to a third-party platform.</p>

  <p>My role was to lead UX design, engage stakeholders, and facilitate front-end development.</p>

  <h2>Guiding stakeholders</h2>
  <p>Leading a team consisting of a BA, PM, and designer - I helped stakeholders bring their content over to the new platform. These ranged from subsidiary businesses BCG's internal professors. The challenge was to onboard them to an unfamiliar platform and process.</p>

  <p>During my time, the learning team started a dedicated transitioned to Agile and I was tasked with developing a model for converting all our user feedback into intiatives to work on and research. To solve this problem, I created a multi-step process of sorting the feedback and then applying existing "Critical to Quality" and "Kano" models.</p>

  <h4>Card Sorting During the Pandemic</h4>
  <p>Analytics identified that learners struggled navigating our catalog.   In the midst of the pandemic, we used a note app (Workflowy) to run virtual card sorting.  This allowed a streamlined interface, where we could duplicate and save each configuration. We discovered that our catalog  was based on an non-intuative business structure.</p>

  <h4>User Interviews</h4>
  <p>We followed card sorting  by building a prototype and running moderated user interviews. For the virtual interviews, I developed scripts that ran on a seperate laptop to keep my connection with the user seamless. Users responded to titles that matched areas for improvement in their quarterly reviews.</p>

  <h4>Rapid Prototypes = Rapid Results</h4>
  <p>During prototyping, we used our feedback model to overlay data, problems, and solutions. This helped demo new designs to stakeholders and back it up with researh. Our biggest challenge was to provide a streamlined, personalized experience for learners, despite some confusing, fixed UI in the learning management system (LMS). Our solution was to focus on entry points and side-steped the LMS, instead of competing. We created a new landing and micro-site pages that guide learners through personalized learning journeys.</p>

  <h2>Getting my hands dirty with development</h2>
  <p>The platform which we developed, provided a unique set of challenges with the chief among them being a restriction in the code we could use. When thinking about developing a UI pattern library to pull from, we only had HTML & CSS to work with. Through going back to basics, we were able to provide customized, interactive UI with clean CSS.</p>
  <p>We also had a unique challenge where we couldn’t use media queries - the standard way to modify a website to be responsive. So this project became a masterclass in using flexbox to create modules that worked across all breakpoints.</p>
  <p>I was brought into BCG as a UX designer with the understanding that they needed some light development work as well.</p>
