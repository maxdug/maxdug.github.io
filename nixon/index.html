  <h1><b>Nixon</b><br>Personalization</h1>
  <h4><b>Agency</b> | Fluid</h4>
  <h4><b>Role</b> | Lead Designer</h4>
  <p>Nixon engaged Fluid to help release their first Android smartwatch: The Mission. We used in-house software called Configure. I lead Nixon through the selection and structuring of watch features to create a product page that gave users a personalized experience.</p>

  <h3>Re-envisioning the product page</h3>
  <p>We kept the Nixon look and feel within the technical framework of the Configure software.  We utilized an accordion pattern with scrolling on desktop and full listings on mobile. We achieved success by helping Nixon  rethink their approach to product pages while launch their first smart watch.</p>
