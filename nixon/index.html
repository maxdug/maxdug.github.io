    <h1><b>Nixon</b><br>Personalization</h1>
    <h3><b>Company</b> | Fluid</h3>
    <h3><b>Date</b> | June 2016</h3>
    <p>After a a successful site redesign, Nixon wanted to use Fluid's Configure customization platform for the the release of their first Androidwear smart watch - The Mission. I was brought in to lead Nixon through the process of selecting which base features were needed and how to structure them to create the most intuitive experience.</p>

<h2>Complex Challenges</h2>
<p>There are lots of customization tools popping up, but I found the they take the user on complex journeys that require prior knowledge of that specific tool. I strove to make our system as uncomplicated as possible, within the technical framework of the Configure system and keeping the overall look and structure feeling like a part of the Nixon product page family.</p>

<h2>Unique Solutions</h2>
<p>In the end, I believe we achieved a huge success in Nixon not just launching a smart watch, but a custom PDP that was simple and intuitive for the user. For the main menu of the interface, we went with a standard accordion design. In order to increase options, we had to add scrolling on desktop and extend options on mobile.</p>
