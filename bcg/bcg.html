  <h1><b>LAB</b><br>Learning at BCG</h1>
  <h4><b>Role</b> | Senior Product Designer</h4>
  <p>Boston Consulting Group is one of the "Big Three" management consultancies globally and has the second-largest revenue. In 2019, I joined LAB, BCG's internal learning team, as a senior product designer to help LAB transition from an in-house learning management system to a customized third-party platform.</p>

  <h3>Overlaying Data</h3>
  <p>The first step in analyzing the new learning platform was to map the experience end-to-end. This allowed the team to identify easy wins and envision a happy path. From this master user flow, my team and I broke out discrete flows and layered qualitative data to show context and help stakeholders prioritize improvements.</p>

  <h3>Card Sorting During the Pandemic</h3>
  <p>Analytics identified that learners struggled to navigate our catalog. We used a note app (Workflowy) to run virtual card sorting during the pandemic. This allowed a streamlined interface where we could duplicate and save each configuration. We discovered that our catalog was based on a non-intuitive business structure.</p>

  <h3>User Interviews</h3>
  <p>We followed card sorting by building a prototype and running moderated user interviews. I developed a discussion guide for the virtual interviews that ran on a separate laptop to keep my conversation with the participants seamless. Participants responded to titles that matched areas for improvement in their quarterly reviews.</p>

  <h3>Visual Design That’s Not From Scratch</h3>
  <p>We utilized a pattern library based on Atomic Design principles to keep our work across stakeholders and platforms consistent. A huge plus with utilizing modular design components is that nailing down their logic saves valuable time in development since all the teams are using the same vernacular.</p>

  <h2>Digging Into Development</h2>
  <p>In addition to my product design work, I took over some light development work. The LMS platform had unique restrictions, limiting us to pure HTML & CSS and not allowing media queries to target specific breakpoints. With these limitations, this project became a masterclass in using Flexbox to create modules that worked across all breakpoints.
