        <h4><b>Agency</b> | Razorfish</h4>
        <h4><b>Role</b> | Associate Design Director</h4>
        <p>CVS challenged Razorfish to incorporate their health and wellness mission into a redesign of their online shopping experience. I went on to lead CVS projects across the B2B and B2C spectrum as UX / Visual lead with additional UX, visual, and copy support on my team.</p>

    <h3>Establishing a Culture of Collaboration</h3>
    <p>We introduced a new design process that aligned cross-functional stakeholders. The double diamond model included regular check-ins that I facilitated to ensure everyone understood where we were in the timeline and what to expect next.  Another tool we introduced was a user persona called the “informed household manager.” This persona helped everyone feel involved in the creative strategy approach and built empathy for our users.</p>

    <h3>Customizing Deliverables for Client Needs</h3>
    <p>For the CVS Drug Information Center, we expedited our process and combined the content analysis into our user flow. This allowed us to workshop with the client on what was possible and got us into design quicker.</p>

    <h3>Elevating Look &amp; Feel</h3>
    <p>Our vision was to take their current design language from clinical to health and wellness focused. We created a system that utilized geometric  shapes, iconography, and line work. We designed modules to showcase lifestyle photography. The polished yet playful design elevates the experience and injects character and personality.</p>

  <h3>Developing a Design System</h3>
  <p>We started building the design system in the discovery phase of the process and evolved it as the project progressed. I kept our team focused on the long term modularity and how components worked together. This increased prototyping speed and overall robustness. A big benefit this afforded was the ability to conduct accessibility reviews at the design system level.</p>

  <h3>CVS Shop Redesign</h3>
  <p>CVS challenged my team to rethink their e-commerce experience. They wanted the online experience to match their in-store health and wellness mission. By assigning categories to their new secondary colors, we improved the visual and functional experience. We gave customers full control over their fulfillment method and the ability to set a preference at any point in the experience, much like food delivery apps.</p>

  <h3>CVS Media Exchange® (CMX)</h3>
  <p>CMX leverages data from CVS’s distinctive customer base to provide personalized brand marketing. They came to us to relaunch CMX from an outdated single information page to a microsite. The unique challenge with this project was to mix business and data messaging with a design that shared CVS's health and wellness mission.</p>
